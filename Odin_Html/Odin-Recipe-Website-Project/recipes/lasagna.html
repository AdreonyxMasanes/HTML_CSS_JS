                            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion,
                            and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 
                            and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
                        </p>

                            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                            Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                            Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
                            Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil:
                            to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. 
                            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.

                    <li>
                        <p>
