                <h2>
                    Pure. Chocolate. Heaven. This brownie recipe guarantees that you will never go back to a boxed brownie mix, 
                    let alone try yet another brownie recipe.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These are not only super fudgy, easy to make brownies that are ready to eat about 15 minutes after pulling them out of the oven (being careful NOT to burn yourself), 
                    each brownie comes full of melted chocolate lava chunks throughout.They are absolutely incredibly fudgy the next day AND the day after that, 
                    and even stay fudgy after freezing them OR eating them cold out of the refrigerator up to a week later.
                <p>
                    Many of my readers have been doubling our recipe to get thicker, fatter brownies, 
                    substituting half of the white sugar for light brown sugar (as suggested in the notes section) and getting amazing results.
                    After passing these around to my neighbours and friends, hearing the moans coming out of each and 
                    every one of them while slowly sinking their teeth into these brownies, 
                    I knew in my heart this recipe is a winner.
                    The batter itself is to DIE for! Good luck NOT licking the spoon and bowl clean.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Preheat oven to 175 degrees celcius
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Lightly grease an 8x12-inch baking pan* with cooking oil spray. 
                            Line with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Combine melted butter, oil and sugars together in a medium-sized bowl. 
                            Whisk well to combine. 
                            Add the eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter in colour (another minute).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. 
                            Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until 
                            JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing so well affect the texture of your brownies).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Fold in three quarters of the chocolate chips
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly, 
                            and top with the remaining chocolate pieces.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Bake for 25-30 minutes for just under-done brownies</strong>(fudgier texture) or until the centre of the brownies no longer jiggles and is JUST set to the touch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Or 35-40 minutes if you like your brownies well set and firm.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>
                                Note: Brownies will continue baking and set in the hot pan out of the oven. If testing with a toothpick, 
                                the toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies.
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After 15-20 minutes, carefully remove them out of the pan and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into 16 brownies. 
                            They set while they cool.
                        </p>
